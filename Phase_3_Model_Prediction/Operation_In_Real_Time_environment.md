In a live application, this air quality monitoring system would be a distributed streaming pipeline. Air quality sensors dispersed across cities would be continuously taking readings of air quality parameters (CO, NOx, temperature, humidity) and pushing data to edge gateways over wireless networks. The edge gateways would perform initial data validation and compression and then push the reading to a Kafka cluster, which is the system's central nervous system.
The Kafka cluster would receive high-speed data streams through partitioned topics, offering scalable sensor data ingestion. Stream processing modules (e.g., Kafka Streams) would enrich the raw data in real time - calculating air quality indices, generating 5-minute rolling averages acting as continuous stream of data, and tagging anomalous readings. Concurrently, a consumer group would persist the processed data in a time-series database optimized for querying by time, and yet another consumer group would ingest data into machine learning models to make predictions about pollution.
Predictive models (like the Linear Regression model) would run in containerized environments, consuming streaming data from a given Kafka topic. Models would generate minute-ahead pollution forecasts from real-time sensor readings and historical trends. Predictions would trigger automatic alarm systems on threshold breaches, which would alert city officials' panels and municipal control systems. Concurrently, visualization services would be reading the processed stream to update public air quality maps and mobile apps in real time. Kafka consumer auto scaling during pollution spikes and constant model retraining with new data held in cloud storage would be included in the system.
